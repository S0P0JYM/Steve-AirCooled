# Mechanic System (Offline, Single-Page App)

This is a **fully offline HTML app** for a mechanic shop with:
- **Login** (default: `admin` / `admin`)
- **Customers, Vehicles, Inventory** – full **CRUD** with search & CSV export
- **Work Orders** – labor & parts, **tax**, **totals**, and **printable invoices**
- **Users management** and **Backup/Restore** (export/import JSON)
- Data stored in **localStorage**

## Usage
1. Extract the ZIP.
2. Open `index.html` in a modern browser (Chrome/Edge).
3. Login with `admin` / `admin`.
4. Add a Customer → Vehicle → create a Work Order. Click **Print** to print an invoice.

> Everything runs on your device; no server or internet is required.
